# KnockKnock_Remastered
A edited version of an old project. 
A spin on the classic knock knock program, this will output unique responses each time the correct string is not entered..
Changes made include:
- using a queue for the String responses instead of an array. The queue data structure better fits the needs of this list.
- filtering out all non-alphabetic characters in the user inputs to better evaluate if the string is valid.
